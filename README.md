# Baby's first markdown
## In which I learn about markdown
**Bolding some text with double asterisks** and *italicizing others with single asterisks*
Here's where I insert a link to [the text that taught me these basic markdown forms](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
still not sure what to use the `code` command for, but since code is the foundation of all of this I'm excited to learn more
I've now saved the document and will be uploading this again

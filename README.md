# Baby's first markdown
## In which I learn about markdown
**Bolding some text with double asterisks** and *italicizing others with single asterisks*
Here's where I insert a link to [the text that taught me these basic markdown forms](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
still not sure what to use the `code` command for, but since code is the foundation of all of this I'm excited to learn more
I've now saved the document and will be uploading this again
<br/>
Since the last upload went live, I realize I forgot two things<br>
1. I didn't include a numbered list, which is of interest to me<br>
2. I hadn't yet learned how to include line breaks, which is rectified from here on out and will *remain* rectified
